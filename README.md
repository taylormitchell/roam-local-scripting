# Roam local scripting

Write and edit scripts locally and auto-execute them in Roam.

## Getting started

1. Start server: `npm start`
2. Create websocket connection to server from Roam by taking the content of the `client.js` file and running it in the console.
3. Create a script in the `scripts` folder. The script will be executed when the file is saved.
